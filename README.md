# CNC-Tool-Wear-Prediction
A predictive maintenance project that estimates CNC tool flank wear (VB_mm) from sensor data using time-series feature extraction and sliding window techniques. The model enables real-time monitoring, early warning, and failure prediction to reduce downtime and improve machining reliability.
